About
=====

We use `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ on all our Linux servers and our documentation is written with this in mind. We tried to be as platform-agnostic when writing as possible, but there may be times when you must use different commands or paths that apply to your system. If you are trying to choose a platform, we recommend you choose Ubuntu for its stability, ease of use, up-to-date packages, and large following.

This documentation is not meant to be a one size fits all solution. We have written it to be useful for a broad scope of applications, but one must adapt it to their situation. For questions, help, corrections, or just to let us know what you're doing, contact us at the address below.
